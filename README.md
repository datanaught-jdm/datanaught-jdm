- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @datanaught-jdm
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a wide range of things, including many aspects of technology ranging from IT to computer science. I also love tinkering with things
that are mechanical. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on re-learning how to code, after taking a substantial hiatus from coding. I have become a victim of ready-to-use tools and user
friendliness - it has not been necessary for me to code, but rather I have been able to use ready-made tools and scripting to accomplish my goals lately. I
hope to use this GitHub repository to track coding projects that I will use to revitalize and hone those rusty old skills.
